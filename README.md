# TinyTrainable

## About

TinyTrainable is an Arduino library, part of the project Tiny Trainable Instruments [https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments), created by Aarón Montoya-Moraga.

This library is being written between December 2020 and August 2021, with help from undergrad researcher Peter Tone and Maxwell Wang.
