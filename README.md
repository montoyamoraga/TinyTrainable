# TinyTrainable

## About

TinyTrainable is an Arduino library, part of the project Tiny Trainable Instruments [https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments), created by Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga, a research assistant at MIT Media Lab's Opera of the Future and Future Sketches research groups.

This library is being written between December 2020 and August 2021, with help from undergrad researchers Peter Tone and Maxwell Wang.

## Distribution

This Arduino library is available on this repository [https://github.com/montoyamoraga/TinyTrainable](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/TinyTrainable), and can also be installed on the Arduino IDE.

## Dependencies

The dependencies of this library are specified on the [library.properties](library.properties) file, which include:

* [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library): for output with screen.
* [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306): for output with screen.

### Source code

The source code is distributed in the following files and folders:

* TinyTrainable.h and TinyTrainable.cpp: base classes for the library.
* inputs/: base classes for each input.
* outputs/: base classes for each output.
* tensorflow_speech: additional code for speech recognition, authored by the TensorFlow team.

### Examples

The examples are distributed in 4 folders, ordered alphabetically and in terms of complexity:

* check: no input, intended to check the wiring of the instruments.
* color: color input.
* gesture: gesture input.
* speech: speech input.

Each of these folders contains one example for each of the available outputs:

* buzzer
* led
* midi
* printer
* screen
* serial
* servo

There is one additional helper example called get_gesture_data, for capturing gesture data for creating your own gesture database.

## Hardware

This library is intended to be used with the microcontroller Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, and the bill of materials available at [https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments/blob/main/docs/0-bill-of-materials.md](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments/blob/main/docs/0-bill-of-materials.md)

## Releases
